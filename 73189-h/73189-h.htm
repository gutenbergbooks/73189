<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>I have often thought that at the side of the
poetic diction, which everyone condemns,
modern verse contains a great deal of poetic
material, using poetic in the same special
sense. The poetry of exaltation will be
always the highest; but when men lose
their poetic feeling for ordinary life, and
cannot write poetry of ordinary things, their
exalted poetry is likely to lose its strength
of exaltation, in the way men cease to build
beautiful churches when they have lost
happiness in building shops.</p>

<p>Many of the older poets, such as Villon
and Herrick and Burns, used the whole of
their personal life as their material, and the
verse written in this way was read by strong
men, and thieves, and deacons, not by little
cliques only. Then, in the town writing of
the eighteenth century, ordinary life was
put into verse that was not poetry, and
when poetry came back with Coleridge and
Shelley, it went into verse that was not always
human.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>In these days poetry is usually a flower of
evil or good; but it is the timber of poetry
that wears most surely, and there is no
timber that has not strong roots among the
clay and worms.</p>

<p>Even if we grant that exalted poetry can
be kept successful by itself, the strong
things of life are needed in poetry also, to
show that what is exalted or tender is not
made by feeble blood. It may almost be
said that before verse can be human again it
must learn to be brutal.</p>

<p>The poems which follow were written at
different times during the last sixteen or
seventeen years, most of them before the
views just stated, with which they have little
to do, had come into my head.</p>

<p>The translations are sometimes free, and
sometimes almost literal, according as seemed
most fitting with the form of language I
have used.</p>

<p>Life is flying from me, not stopping an
hour, and Death is making great strides
following my track. The days about me
and the days passed over me, are bringing
me desolation, and the days to come will be
the same surely.</p>

<p>All things that I am bearing in mind, and
all things I am in dread of, are keeping me
in troubles, in this way one time, in that
way another time, so that if I wasn’t taking
pity on my own self it’s long ago I’d have
given up my life.</p>

<p>If my dark heart has any sweet thing it
is turned away from me, and then farther off
I see the great winds where I must be sailing.
I see my good luck far away in the harbour,
but my steersman is tired out, and the masts
and the ropes on them are broken, and the
beautiful lights where I would be always
looking are quenched.</p>

<p>What is it you’re thinking, lonesome
heart? For what is it you’re turning back
ever and always to times that are gone away
from you? For what is it you’re throwing
sticks on the fire where it is your own self
that is burning?</p>

<p>The little looks and sweet words you’ve
taken one by one and written down among
your songs, are gone up into the Heavens,
and it’s late, you know well, to go seeking
them on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Let you not be giving new life every day
to your own destruction, and following a
fool’s thoughts for ever. Let you seek Heaven
when there is nothing left pleasing on the
earth, and it a poor thing if a great beauty,
the like of her, would be destroying your
peace and she living or dead.</p>

<p>In the years of her age the most beautiful
and the most flowery—the time Love has
his mastery—Laura, who was my life, has
gone away leaving the earth stripped and
desolate. She has gone up into the Heavens,
living and beautiful and naked, and from
that place she is keeping her Lordship and
her rein upon me, and I crying out: Ohone,
when will I see that day breaking that will
be my first day with herself in Paradise?</p>

<p>My thoughts are going after her, and it
is that way my soul would follow her, lightly,
and airily, and happily, and I would be rid
of all my great troubles. But what is
delaying me is the proper thing to lose me
utterly, to make me a greater weight on my
own self.</p>

<p>Oh, what a sweet death I might have died
this day three years to-day!</p>

<p>If the birds are making lamentation, or the
green banks are moved by a little wind of
summer, or you can hear the waters making
a stir by the shores that are green and flowery.</p>

<p>That’s where I do be stretched out thinking
of love, writing my songs, and herself
that Heaven shows me though hidden in the
earth I set my eyes on, and hear the way
that she feels my sighs and makes an answer
to me.</p>

<p>“Alas,” I hear her say, “why are you
using yourself up before the time is come,
and pouring out a stream of tears so sad and
doleful.</p>

<p>“You’d do right to be glad rather, for in
dying I won days that have no ending, and
when you saw me shutting up my eyes I was
opening them on the light that is eternal.”</p>

<p>The hair that was of shining gold, and
brightness of the smile that was the like of
an angel’s surely, and was making a paradise
of the earth, are turned to a little dust that
knows nothing at all.</p>

<p>And yet I myself am living; it is for this
I am making a complaint to be left without
the light I had such a great love for, in good
fortune and bad, and this will be the end of
my songs of love, for the vein where I had
cleverness is dried up, and every thing I
have is turned to complaint only.</p>

that are after taking her, and shutting her in
with greediness, the Heavens that do push
their bolt against so many.</p>

<p>What a grudge I am bearing the blessed
saints that have got her sweet company, that
I am always seeking; and what a grudge
I am bearing against Death, that is standing
in her two eyes, and will not call me with
a word.</p>

INCREASES PETRARCH’S SORROW</h2>
</div>


<p>The south wind is coming back, bringing
the fine season, and the flowers, and the grass,
her sweet family, along with her. The
swallow and the nightingale are making a
stir, and the spring is turning white and red
in every place.</p>

<p>There is a cheerful look on the meadows,
and peace in the sky, and the sun is well
pleased, I’m thinking, looking downward,
and the air and the waters and the earth
herself are full of love, and every beast is
turning back looking for its mate.</p>

<p>And what is coming to me is great sighing
and trouble, which herself is drawing
out of my deep heart, herself that has taken
the key of it up to Heaven.</p>

<p>And it is this way I am, that the singing
birds, and the flowers of the earth, and the
sweet ladies, with their grace and comeliness,
are the like of a desert to me, and wild beasts
astray in it.</p>

CRUELTY OF DEATH</h2>

<p>My flowery and green age was passing
away, and I feeling a chill in the fires had
been wasting my heart, for I was drawing
near the hillside that is above the grave.</p>

<p>Then my sweet enemy was making a
start, little by little, to give over her great
wariness, the way she was wringing a sweet
thing out of my sharp sorrow. The time
was coming when Love and Decency can
keep company, and lovers may sit together
and say out all things are in their hearts.
But Death had his grudge against me, and
he got up in the way, like an armed robber,
with a pike in his hand.</p>

<p>Is this the nest in which my Phœnix

Phœnix that did hold me under her wing,
and she drawing out sweet words and sighs
from me? Oh, root of my sweet misery,
where is that beautiful face, where light
would be shining out, the face that did
keep my heart like a flame burning? She
was without a match upon the earth, I
hear them say, and now she is happy in
the Heavens.</p>

<p>And she has left me after her dejected
and lonesome, turning back all times to the
place I do be making much of for her sake
only, and I seeing the night on the little
hills where she took her last flight up into
the Heavens, and where one time her eyes
would make sunshine and it night itself.</p>

ONLY HE WHO MOURNS HER AND<br>
HEAVEN THAT POSSESSES HER,<br>
KNEW HER WHILE SHE LIVED<br>

</div>


<p>Ah, Death, it is you that have left the world
cold and shady, with no sun over it. It’s you
have left Love without eyes or arms to him,
you’ve left liveliness stripped, and beauty
without a shape to her, and all courtesy in
chains, and honesty thrown down into a hole.
I am making lamentation alone, though it
isn’t myself only has a cause to be crying
out; since you, Death, have crushed the
first seed of goodness in the whole world,
and with it gone what place will we find a
second?</p>

<p>The air and the earth and seas would
have a good right to be crying out—and
they pitying the race of men that is left
without herself, like a meadow without
flowers or a ring robbed of jewellery.</p>

<p>The world didn’t know her the time she
was in it, but I myself knew her—and I left
now to be weeping in this place; and the
Heavens knew her, the Heavens that are
giving an ear this day to my crying out.</p>

<p>The first day she passed up and down
through the Heavens, gentle and simple
were left standing, and they in great
wonder, saying one to the other:</p>

<p>“What new light is that? What new
beauty at all? The like of herself hasn’t
risen up these long years from the common
world.”</p>

<p>And herself, well pleased with the
Heavens, was going forward, matching
herself with the most perfect that were
before her, yet one time, and another,
waiting a little, and turning her head back
to see if myself was coming after her. It’s
for that I’m lifting up all my thoughts and
will into the Heavens, because I do hear
her praying that I should be making haste
for ever.</p>

PRAYER OF THE OLD WOMAN,<br>
VILLON’S MOTHER</h2>
</div>

<p>Mother of God that’s Lady of the Heavens,
take myself, the poor sinner, the way I’ll be
along with them that’s chosen.</p>

<p>Let you say to your own Son that He’d
have a right to forgive my share of sins,
when it’s the like He’s done, many’s the day,
with big and famous sinners. I’m a poor
aged woman, was never at school, and is no
scholar with letters, but I’ve seen pictures in
the chapel with Paradise on one side, and
harps and pipes in it, and the place on the
other side, where sinners do be boiled in
torment; the one gave me great joy, the
other a great fright and scaring; let me have
the good place, Mother of God, and it’s in
your faith I’ll live always.</p>

<p>It’s yourself that bore Jesus, that has no
end or death, and He the Lord Almighty,
that took our weakness and gave Himself to
sorrows, a young and gentle man. It’s
Himself is our Lord surely, and it’s in that
faith I’ll live always.</p>

AN OLD WOMAN’S LAMENTATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p>The man I had a love for—a great rascal
would kick me in the gutter—is dead thirty
years and over it, and it is I am left behind,
grey and aged. When I do be minding the
good days I had, minding what I was one
time, and what it is I’m come to, and when
I do look on my own self, poor and dry, and
pinched together, it wouldn’t be much would
set me raging in the streets.</p>

<p>Where is the round forehead I had, and
the fine hair, and the two eyebrows, and the
eyes with a big gay look out of them would
bring folly from a great scholar? Where is
my straight, shapely nose, and two ears, and
my chin with a valley in it, and my lips were
red and open?</p>

<p>Where are the pointed shoulders were on
me, and the long arms and nice hands to
them? Where is my bosom was as white as
any, or my straight rounded sides?</p>

<p>It’s the way I am this day—my forehead
is gone away into furrows, the hair of my
head is grey and whitish, my eyebrows are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
tumbled from me, and my two eyes have
died out within my head—those eyes that
would be laughing to the men—my nose
has a hook on it, my ears are hanging down,
and my lips are sharp and skinny.</p>

<p>That’s what’s left over from the beauty of
a right woman—a bag of bones, and legs
the like of two shrivelled sausages going
beneath it.</p>

<p>It’s of the like of that we old hags do
be thinking, of the good times are gone
away from us, and we crouching on our
hunkers by a little fire of twigs, soon
kindled and soon spent, we that were the
pick of many.</p>

COMPLAINS TO HIS PATRON<br>

<p class="center"><i>From the Old French</i></p>


<p>I’m getting old in your big house, and
you’ve never stretched your hand with a bit
of gold to me, or a day’s wages itself. By
my faith in Mary, it’s not that way I’ll serve
you always, living on my pocket, with a few
coppers only, and a small weight in my bag.
You’ve had me to this day, singing on your
stairs before you, but I’m getting a good
mind to be going off, when I see my purse
flattened out, and my wife does be making
a fool of me from the edge of the door.</p>

<p>It’s another story I hear when I come
home at night and herself looks behind me,
and sets her eye on my bag stuffed to bursting,
and I maybe with a grey, decent coat
on my back. It’s that time she’s not long
leaving down her spinning and coming with
a smile, ready to choke me with her two
hands squeezing my neck. It’s then my sons
have a great rage to be rubbing the sweat
from my horse, and my daughter isn’t long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
wringing the necks on a pair of chickens,
and making a stew in the pot. It’s that day
my youngest will bring me a towel, and she
with nice manners.... It’s a full purse, I
tell you, makes a man lord in his own house.</p>

<p>I never set my two eyes on a head was so
fine as your head, but I’d no way to be
looking down into your heart.</p>

<p>It’s for that I was tricked out and out—that
was the thanks I got for being so steady
in my love.</p>

<p>I tell you, if I could have laid my hands
on the whole set of the stars, the moon and
the sun along with it, by Christ I’d have
given the lot to her. No place have I set
eyes on the like of her; she’s bad to her
friends, and gay and playful with those she’d
have a right to hate. I ask you can that
behaviour have a good end come to it?</p>

SILVIA</h2>
</div>

<p>Are you bearing in mind that time when there
was a fine look out of your eyes, and yourself,
pleased and thoughtful, were going up
the boundaries that are set to childhood?
That time the quiet rooms, and the lanes about
the house, would be noisy with your songs
that were never tired out; the time you’d be
sitting down with some work that is right
for women, and well pleased with the hazy
coming times you were looking out at in
your own mind.</p>

<p>May was sweet that year, and it was
pleasantly you’d pass the day.</p>

<p>Then I’d leave my pleasant studies, and
the paper I had smudged with ink where I
would be spending the better part of the
day, and cock my ears from the sill of my
father’s house, till I’d hear the sound of your
voice, or of your loom when your hands
moved quickly. It’s then I would set store
of the quiet sky and the lanes and little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
places, and the sea was far away in one place
and the high hills in another.</p>

<p>There is no tongue will tell till the judgment
what I feel in myself those times.</p>
